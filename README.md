# Wiggles & Wonders — Expo Placeholder App

This is a lightweight, storybook‑styled prototype to demo to funders.

## How to run
1. Install Node.js LTS and Expo CLI if needed: `npm i -g expo-cli` (optional with npx).
2. In this folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx expo start
   ```
3. Open the Expo Go app on your phone and scan the QR code.

## Notes
- Images are simple placeholders created locally (rainbows, trees, clouds).
- Replace `assets/backgrounds/*.png` and `assets/logo.png` with your brand art anytime.
- Screens are in `App.js`. Navigation uses `@react-navigation/native-stack`.
